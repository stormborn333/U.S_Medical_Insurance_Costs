# U.S Medical Insurance Costs
It's my second Data Science project on GitHub. This time I was analyzing data about patients from US. The purpose of this project was to conduct an analysis using only Python built-in only options such as a dictionaries, lists etc. I didn't use Pandas and NumPy for a reason, I wanted to practise my Python skills in more-like DS project. In this Jupyer Notebook you can find things like: calculating an average insurance cost, comparison of insurance costs for men and women, calculating an average insurance cost for every age group. Data is from Data Scientist path course on Codecademy.
